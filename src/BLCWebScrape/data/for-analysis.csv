Giving up plenty of ripe black cherry, mulberries, and cassis-like fruit as well as textbook Pauillac lead pencil, forest floor, and tobacco, it's medium to full-bodied, has good mid-palate density, subtle background oak, ripe yet building tannins, and a great finish. It shows the vintage's more elegant, classic style yet doesn't lack for concentration or length. It's going to benefit from just 3-4 years of bottle age and drink fabulously well for two decades. It's the finest d'Armailhac I've tasted.""

Rich, exuberant, and straight up sexy on the palate, it's full-bodied, has a deep, layered mid-palate, building tannins, and a heavenly finish. Just a prodigious, powerful, off-the-charts expression of this terroir, it actually reminds me slightly of the 2005 (or 1998?) with its mix of sexiness and opulence. This is one of the few 2019s that will make your eyes roll back in your head.

Farming Pinot Noir is tricky business and a high bar has been set at Quail's Gate to master this grape. It involves clonal work, rootstocks, fermenting temperatures, barrel selection, stems or no stems or some stems? The end result has been fruit sourced from the finest blocks on Boucherie Road by the winery. Age of vines is important, with some dating to the 1970s.

We poured the wine and took half an hour to get to it, as the wine was very closed at first and opened up very slowly in the glass. Little by little, the nose started showing a floral character, what I consider the perfume of great Ribera del Duero, the elegant part that compensates the powerful nature of the wines and gives the finesse to the best wines. The wine has been very consistent in the last few vintages, as Sisseck reckons the old but balanced vines (they started working in biodynamics in 2000) cushion the vintage differences more than other younger vineyards.

Angel's Envy Rye Finished in Rum Barrels is genuinely unique and worthy of Master Distiller Lincoln Henderson's legacy. The taste profile of rye whiskey was a perfect fit for a rum cask finish. After sampling over 100 rums to find the right flavour to complement rye whiskey, the team's decision was unanimous. Angel's Envy spends up to 18 months finishing in Caribbean rum casks, resulting in an immensely complex whiskey. The mingling of raw, spicy and earthy rye with the mellow sweetness of rum finishing creates an incomparably smooth and drinkable whiskey, even at 100 proof.

In making a fine London Dry gin such as Gilbey's, the fermentation process is similar to whiskey production. The fundamental difference is that the congeners, the natural taste elements that are so necessary to bourbon and scotch are absent. Instead, gin's flavour is introduced to the alcohol when it is in a vaporous form and made to pass through a ""filter"" of juniper berries, herbs and spices.

The agave is slowly steam-cooked before being crushed with a two-ton Tahona. The Tahona is a traditional method that utilizes a two-ton volcanic stone wheel to extract the sugary juice from the agave, which is then fermented, distilled, and aged in barrels. Piedra, which means ""stone"" in Spanish, is created entirely from the traditional Tahona process - a process that few tequilas are made with anymore. After distillation, the tequila is then aged for three years in new American and French oak barrels before being bottled at 80 proof.

This rich, complex single malt takes its unique natural colour and character from first-fill sherry seasoned oak casks from Spain, handcrafted by the master craftsmen of Jerez de la Frontera, the home of sherry. The casks are taken from a single cooperage in order to ensure the infinite quality and character at the heart of this rich single malt. The cooperage exclusively creates Spanish oak casks which, once seasoned with sherry, create the unique flavour of this exquisite whisky. Rich in spice and dried fruit with a layer of heady orange groves, this is an enticing, dark, whisky that delivers classic Macallan character.

The founder Masataka Taketsuru chose the town of Yoichi in Hokkaido because of the similar environmental conditions to Scotland, where he learned whisky-making. Yoichi malts are described as bold and strong with refined peaty notes and smokiness brought by the traditional direct coal-fired distillation. Sea breeze from the Ishikari Bay delivers a briny hint to the whisky during maturation. This no-age-statement version truly captures the authentic style of Yoichi malts. Vatting various different malt whiskies together, this bottling expresses a delicate balance between peaty, smoky and fruity aromas.
